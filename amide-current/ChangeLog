0.4.7
	* can now pick between linear and orthogonal layouts for the 3 views
	* alignment lines work again
	* series views were showing incorrect locations
	* can now erase points from an isocontour ROI
	* dropped double click activating in tree list, too annoying to support in GDK
	* configure script checks for gcc 2.96, and complains loudly if found

0.4.6
	* added 2D and 3D isocontour ROI's
	* no more notion of an "active" roi.  All roi's are now always moveable
	* multiple fixes for closing widgets
	* fix for crashing study parameter window
	* fixed cti import bug that screwed up the value for small frame durations
	* added more logic for dealing with corrupted CTI files
	* canvas event processing functions combined and rewritten for clarity
	* (X)medcon importing now (hopefully) get's scaling constants right
	* specific (X)medcon import fallbacks can be specified by the user
	* added ability to load in PDP and VAX raw data formats
	* can now handle data set with inf and nan values
	* fixed the bug with saving ROI statistics
	* gcc requirement is now listed as gcc 3.0.2
	
0.4.5
	* removed notion of "grains" for calculating ROI statistics
	* added a "scaled" color strip to the threshold widget
	* redesigned the roi analysis dialog box
	* added a button to the roi analysis dialog save stats info to a text file
	* fixed minor bug with time button display
	* fixed minor bug with threshold changes getting lost in volume dialog
	* can now import files from the command line
	* dropped 2x2x1 and 2x2x2 interpolations
	* gtkgammacurve setting is now faster in ui_rendering_dialog
	* can now set the width of drawn roi's as a user preference
	* added a gtkdirsel widget, this means .xif directories look more like files
	* better (but still not perfect) ROI resizing.
	* axis indicators on the roi and data set dialogs
	
0.4.4
	* rendering dialog changed considerably
	  - user can now grab canvas and spin it using buttons 1 and 2
	  - x,y,z rotations have been moved
	  - all rotations are now relative to the canvas
	* rendering parameters dialog fixed up, now allows colormap changing
	* rendering movies can now be done over time
	* can now change the name of the output movie
	* medcon importing importing was a little off, hopefully we
	  have the right scale factors now
	* rewrote the threshold widget as a gtk style widget
	* added toolbar and menu to series widget
	* allow independent thresholding of series display
	* added captions to the series pic's
	* now importing correcting the frame durations of dynamic CTI files
	* now adding in image offsets from CTI files

0.4.3
	* multiple speed improvements (at least 2x faster now for slice generation)
	  -changed multiple functions to defines (based on profiling)
	  -inverse matrix is now pregenerated and stored
	  -default compile is now -O6
	* now have multiple internal data representations (not just float)
	* can have multi-dimensional scaling constants, useful for CTI files 
	  and such that have a scaling constant for each plane (let alone frame)
	* changed color compositing to an alpha based method, so that
	  colormaps with white backgrounds can be composited together
	* changed voxelpoint_t to 4D, volumes are now considered 4D, 
	  rather than 3D with multiple frames
	* new data type, data_set_t.  The volume's data set and distribution
	  array are kept in this format
	* interpolation type used for conversion to a rendering context can
	  now be specified
	* can now export renderings to graphics files
	* added "reset axis" button to rendering dialog
	* fixed a bunch of stupid bugs with the threshold widget
	* no longer save max/min in xml files, as these are regenerated 
	* no longer save far corner in volume .xml files, redundant information
	* fixed stupid bug with the raw data import dialog box
	* fixed problem with adjusting the dimension of ROI's that were not lined
	  up with the transverse plane
	* wait cursor no longer stays on erroneously when series widget used
	* library no longer built by default

0.4.2
	* global scaling is now default for new studies
	* threshold arrows now move better with relation to the cursor
	* keeps better track of which directory we're current working/saving in
	* can now export the views as image files (jpeg/tiff/ps/eps/png/etc.)
	* fixed endian issues with loading in floats and doubles
	* now ensures save files end with .xif
	* numerous build chain bugfixes (now compiles and runs on Mac OS X)
	* rewrote trilinear interpolation (much faster)
	* dropped bilinear interpolation 
	  (doing it correctly would be slower then trilinear)
	* fixed interpolation bug for slices of depth != volume->voxel_size.z
	* upgraded almost all the program from using gdk_imlib to gdk_pixbuf
	* changed the origin of our image volume to the far left bottom corner
	  - world coordinate system is now right handed (this is a good thing)
	  - new .xif version (y axis now points in opposite direction)
	  - medcon, idl, and pem inputs also updated
	  - many many updates to make this change work
	* elimination of several unneeded and confusing realspace functions
	* got rid of the "main" window 
	* changes with command line parsing, no longer use "-i" to specify the
	  input file.  Also can specify multiple input files
	* fixed a long standing problem with destroying already dereferenced
	  roi_item canvas objects - thanks to awu
	* updated config.guess, config.sub, libtool, etc.
