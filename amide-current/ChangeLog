	* changed voxelpoint_t to 4D, volumes are now considered 4D, 
	  rather than 3D with multiple frames

	* now ensures save files end with .xif
	* numerous build chain bugfixes (now compiles and runs on Mac OS X)
	* rewrote trilinear interpolation (much faster)

	  (doing it correctly would be slower then trilinear)
