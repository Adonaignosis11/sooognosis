0.4.4
	* rendering dialog changed considerably
	  - user can now grab canvas and spin it using buttons 1 and 2
	  - x,y,z rotations have been moved
	  - all rotations are now relative to the canvas
	* rendering parameters dialog fixed up, now allows colormap changing
	* rendering movies can now be done over time
	* can now change the name of the output movie
	* medcon importing importing was a little off, hopefully we
	  have the right scale factors now
	* rewrote the threshold widget as a gtk style widget
	* added toolbar and menu to series widget
	* allow independent thresholding of series display
	* added captions to the series pic's
	* now importing correcting the frame durations of dynamic CTI files
	* now adding in image offsets from CTI files

0.4.3
	* multiple speed improvements (at least 2x faster now for slice generation)
	  -changed multiple functions to defines (based on profiling)
	  -inverse matrix is now pregenerated and stored
	  -default compile is now -O6
	* now have multiple internal data representations (not just float)
	* can have multi-dimensional scaling constants, useful for CTI files 
	  and such that have a scaling constant for each plane (let alone frame)
	* changed color compositing to an alpha based method, so that
	  colormaps with white backgrounds can be composited together
	* changed voxelpoint_t to 4D, volumes are now considered 4D, 
	  rather than 3D with multiple frames
	* new data type, data_set_t.  The volume's data set and distribution
	  array are kept in this format
	* interpolation type used for conversion to a rendering context can
	  now be specified
	* can now export renderings to graphics files
	* added "reset axis" button to rendering dialog
	* fixed a bunch of stupid bugs with the threshold widget
	* no longer save max/min in xml files, as these are regenerated 
	* no longer save far corner in volume .xml files, redundant information
	* fixed stupid bug with the raw data import dialog box
	* fixed problem with adjusting the dimension of ROI's that were not lined
	  up with the transverse plane
	* wait cursor no longer stays on erroneously when series widget used
	* library no longer built by default

0.4.2
	* global scaling is now default for new studies
	* threshold arrows now move better with relation to the cursor
	* keeps better track of which directory we're current working/saving in
	* can now export the views as image files (jpeg/tiff/ps/eps/png/etc.)
	* fixed endian issues with loading in floats and doubles
	* now ensures save files end with .xif
	* numerous build chain bugfixes (now compiles and runs on Mac OS X)
	* rewrote trilinear interpolation (much faster)
	* dropped bilinear interpolation 
	  (doing it correctly would be slower then trilinear)
	* fixed interpolation bug for slices of depth != volume->voxel_size.z
	* upgraded almost all the program from using gdk_imlib to gdk_pixbuf
	* changed the origin of our image volume to the far left bottom corner
	  - world coordinate system is now right handed (this is a good thing)
	  - new .xif version (y axis now points in opposite direction)
	  - medcon, idl, and pem inputs also updated
	  - many many updates to make this change work
	* elimination of several unneeded and confusing realspace functions
	* got rid of the "main" window 
	* changes with command line parsing, no longer use "-i" to specify the
	  input file.  Also can specify multiple input files
	* fixed a long standing problem with destroying already dereferenced
	  roi_item canvas objects - thanks to awu
	* updated config.guess, config.sub, libtool, etc.
	
0.4.1
	* MPEG-1 movie generation capabilities added.  Currently, all output
	  files are saved as "out.mpg", due to an obscure gtk? bug.
	* added the ability to do horiz. and vert. leveling with the mouse
	* added an ascii file format for the raw data file input function
	* added a new menu item, so that users can specify the import method
	* added the ability to load in studies from the command line
	* you can now compile and run amide as a library, exported functions
	  are in amide_export.h
	* add a creation date to the study data structure
	* add 'scan_date to the volume structure

0.4.0
	* moved the functionality in the right column to a toolbar on top
	* fixed some dumb errors with the mouse-depth change
	* couple small documentation updates
	* more sensible initial classification function for rendering
	* the density and gradient classification functions now work correctly
	  for multiple volumes
	* fixed stupid bug in rendering_context_free()
	* rendering parameters dialog changes now make more sense
	* did a first-draft of user documentation for rendering 
	
0.3.5
	* added Hot Blue/Hot Green colormaps
	* changed study tree from GtkCTree to GtkTree
	* context sensitive help window working better
	* add/edit/delete buttons removed from main panel
	* when moving an ROI, the view_center is now linked to the center of the ROI
	* disabled bug-reporting, as I only read the sourceforge bug reports
	
0.3.4
	* corrected stupid roi-zooming error, although roi-zooming still not correct
	* added a little display to indicate the current coordinates
	* added a continously running help window to indicate what the different
	  mouse buttons indicate at any given time.
	* corrected activating an object without selecting it (now not possible)

0.3.3
	* added "targets" onto the canvases
	* can now change thickness by click-n-dragging on canvases
	* fixed rotating of roi's by mouse-click-n-dragging.  Zooming still doesn't work right
	* mouse cursors now work correctly
	* fixed fatal errors in loading in many types of raw data 
	        (unsigned shorts, unsigned ints, etc.)
	* fixed a fatal error in referencing a free'd ui_threshold structure
	* blank images are now background color, not black
	* the currently active object is now noted in the study tree
	* code cleanups
	
0.3.2
	* big endian compile fix
	* additional viewing parameters saved in amide study files

0.3.1
	* multiple fixes with viewing series of images
	* multiple fixes with calculating roi statistics

0.3.0
	* added study parameter modification dialog
	* accelerated nearest neighbhor reslicing by a factor of 5
	* massive bug hunt

0.2.4
	* added loading/saving support in an XML file format

0.2.3
	* added volume rendering support
	* numerous bug fixes
