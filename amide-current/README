AMIDE stands for: AMIDE's a Medical Image Data Examiner

AMIDE is intended for viewing and analyzing 3D medical imaging data
sets.  For more information on AMIDE, check out the AMIDE web page at:
	http://amide.sourceforge.net

AMIDE is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL included in the file
COPYING.



Requirements
------------


1) Compiler: 

I currently use gcc-3.0.2, as AMIDE is fairly unstable when compiled
with any previous version of the gcc compiler if optimizations are
used


2) Gtk+/Gnome:

I'm developing on Gtk+-1.2.10/Gnome 1.0 at the moment (i.e. default
Redhat 6.2 install with Ximian on top). 


3) libxml2

Redhat 6.2 at least only comes with libxml.  AMIDE requires libxml2.
Check out http://xmlsoft.org if your version of Linux doesn't have
libxml2.



Optional Packages
-----------------

1) (X)medcon/libmdc

(X)medcon includes a library (libmdc) which allows AMIDE to import the
following formats; Acr/Nema 2.0, Analyze (SPM), DICOM 3.0, Ecat/Matrix
6.4, InterFile3.3 and Gif87a/89a.  Note that CTI format is done by
libecat if available (see below).

(X)medcon can be obtained from: 
	http://xmedcon.sourceforge.net


2) z_matrix_70/libecat

You will need this library if you want to import CTI 6.4 and 7.0 files
[(X)medcon only can handle CTI 6.4].  This library is released under a
non-free license (which is why it's not incuded with AMIDE).  It can
be found on the AMIDE sourceforge website, or at it's original site:

	ftp://dormeur.topo.ucl.ac.be/pub/ecat/z_matrix_70/ecat.tar.gz

The source file off of amide.sourceforge.net is preferable, as it
includes a Makefile which will make a shared library, and a small
patch.  Since the license for libecat is non-GPL compatible, you
really should only link to it as a shared library.  A README file is
included with the tarball that explains how to configure/compile the
library.  RPM packages are also available off the AMIDE web site.



3) volpack/libvolpack

Volpack includes a library (libvolpack) which is used for the optional
volume rendering component of AMIDE.  

The original version can be found at:
	http://graphics.stanford.edu/software/volpack/

The version available on the AMIDE web site is preferable, as it's
been updated to compile cleanly under Linux.  RPM packages are also
available.



Building
--------

see the file INSTALL for info on compiling and installing.  If you
don't feel like reading that, try:

	./configure
	make 
	make install


if you're wondering about configuration options, a lot of information
can be obtained by running:

	./configure --help
