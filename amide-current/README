AMIDE stands for: AMIDE's a Medical Image Data Examiner

AMIDE is intended for viewing and analyzing 3D medical imaging data
sets.  For more information on AMIDE, check out the AMIDE web page at:

AMIDE is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL included in the file
COPYING.



Requirements
------------

1) Compiler: 

I currently use gcc-2.95.2, as amide is fairly unstable when compiled
with egcs-1.1.2 

2) Gtk+/Gnome:

I'm developing on Gtk+-1.2.8/Gnome 1.0 at the moment (i.e. default
Redhat 6.2 install). 


Optional Packages
-----------------


1) libecat (also called z_matrix_70)

You will need this library if you want to import CTI (6.4 and 7.0)
files.  This library is released under a non-free license (which is
why it's not incuded with amide).  It can be found on the amide
sourceforge website, or at it's original site:

	ftp://dormeur.topo.ucl.ac.be/pub/ecat/z_matrix_70/ecat.tar.gz

The source file off of amide.sourceforge.net is preferable, as it
includes a Makefile which will make a shared library, and a small
patch.  Since the license for libecat is non-GPL compatible, you
really should only link to it as a shared library.  A README file is
included with the tarball that explains how to configure/compile the
lbirary.

2) xmedcon

This can be obtained from:
	http://xmedcon.sourceforge.net

Xmedcon includes a library (libmdc) which supports the following
formats; Acr/Nema 2.0, Analyze (SPM), DICOM 3.0, Ecat/Matrix 6.4,
InterFile3.3 and Gif87a/89a.  Note that CTI format is done by libecat
if libmdc is available.  If you're compiling in support for using both
libmdc and libecat, make sure to compile libmdc without CTI support or
else you're going to run into namespace bugs when trying to load in
any file through libmdc.




Building
--------

see the file INSTALL for info on compiling and installing.  If you
don't feel like reading that, try:

	./configure
	make 
	make install
