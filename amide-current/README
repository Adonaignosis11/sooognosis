AMIDE stands for: AMIDE's a Medical Image Data Examiner

AMIDE is intended for viewing and analyzing 3D medical imaging data
sets.  For more information on AMIDE, check out the AMIDE web page at:
	http://amide.sourceforge.net

AMIDE is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL included in the file
COPYING.



Requirements
------------


1) Compiler: 

I currently use gcc-4.1.  The later 3.* series (e.g. 3.3) should work
as well, along with version 2.95.  Early 3.* Versions of gcc will
quite likely generate compilation errors (and make AMIDE unstable) if
optimizations are used when compiling.  The 2.96 versions of gcc
(which are not official releases!) are particularly notorious.



2) Gtk+/Gnome:

The current series of AMIDE requires Gtk+-2 and GNOME-2.  I'm
currently developing on a Fedora Core 6.0 system, although other
distributions of Linux with equivalent library support should work.

Very old distributions (e.g. Redhat <= 7.2, the previous Debian
release) will require a large number of new packages to be installed
to get the current version of AMIDE to compile and run.  If you want
to run AMIDE on such a system, you might try the (ancient) AMIDE 0.6.*
series, which only needs Gtk+-1.2/Gnome-1.4.

Scrollkeeper is required for generating the help documentation.  If
you don't care about that, it's not needed.


Optional Packages
-----------------


1) (X)MedCon/libmdc

(X)MedCon includes a library (libmdc) which allows AMIDE to import the
following formats; Acr/Nema 2.0, Analyze (SPM), Concorde microPET,
DICOM 3.0, ECAT/Matrix 6/7, InterFile3.3 and Gif87a/89a. Note that the
default compile of XMedCon is reliant on GLib/GTK 1.2, which very few
programs use anymore so it may not be installed on your system. It is
possible to compile XMedCon without GUI support and thereby not need
GLib/GTK 1.2 for compilation.

(X)MedCon can be obtained from: 
	http://xmedcon.sourceforge.net

2) DCMTK - DICOM Toolkit

DCMTK provides expanded support for DICOM files, allowing the reading
in of many clinical format datasets that (X)MedCon doesn't support.
It can be downloaded at:
	http://dicom.offis.de/dcmtk.php.en


3) z_matrix_70/libecat

This library can be used as an alternative for importing ECAT 6/7
files, and is released under a fairly restrictive license.  It can be
found on the AMIDE sourceforge website, or at it's original site:

	ftp://dormeur.topo.ucl.ac.be/pub/ecat/z_matrix_70/ecat.tar.gz

The source file off of amide.sourceforge.net is preferable, as it
includes a Makefile which will make a shared library, and a small
patch.  Since the license for libecat is non-GPL compatible, you
really should only link to it as a shared library.  A README file is
included with the tarball that explains how to configure/compile the
library.  RPM packages are also available off the AMIDE web site.



4) volpack/libvolpack

Volpack includes a library (libvolpack) which is used for the optional
volume rendering component of AMIDE.  

The original version can be found at:
	http://graphics.stanford.edu/software/volpack/

The version available on the AMIDE web site is preferable, as it's
been updated to compile cleanly under Linux.  RPM packages are also
available.



5) libfame

Another optional package, the fame library is used for generating
MPEG-1 movies from series of rendered images and for generating
fly-through movies.

Information, code, and binaries for libfame can be found at:
	http://fame.sourceforge.net

Linux RPM binaries are available at:
	http://atrpms.net/name/libfame/



Building
--------

See the file INSTALL for info on compiling and installing.  If you
don't feel like reading that, try:

	./configure
	make 
	make install         (as root)


If you're wondering about configuration options, a lot of information
can be obtained by running:

	./configure --help
