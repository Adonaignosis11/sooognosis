Requirements
------------


Optional Packages
-----------------


1) libecat (also called z_matrix_70)

You will need this library if you want to import CTI files.  This
library is released under a non-free license (which is why it's not
incuded with amide).  It can be found on the amide sourceforge
website, or at it's original site:
	ftp://dormeur.topo.ucl.ac.be/pub/ecat/z_matrix_70/ecat.tar.gz

The source file off of amide.sourceforge.net is preferable, as it
includes a Makefile which will make a shared library, and a small
patch.  Since the license for libecat is non-GPL compatible, you
really should only link to it as a shared library.

To build:
	download the tarball
	tar -xvzf libecat_amide_2000.8.29.tgz
	cd z_matrix_70
	patch -p1 < amide_patch
	make
	cp libecat.so.1.0 /usr/local/lib
	cp matrix.h /usr/local/include
	/sbin/ldconfig (make sure /etc/ld.so.conf includes /usr/local/lib)
	cd /usr/local/lib
	ln -s libecat.so.1.0 libecat.so

And that should do it.



Building
--------

see the file INSTALL for info on compiling and installing.  If you
don't feel like reading that, try:

	./configure
	make
