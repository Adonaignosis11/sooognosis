AMIDE stands for: AMIDE's a Medical Image Data Examiner

AMIDE is intended for viewing and analyzing 3D medical imaging data
sets.  For more information on AMIDE, check out the AMIDE web page at:
	http://amide.sourceforge.net

AMIDE is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL included in the file
COPYING.



Requirements
------------


1) Compiler: 

I currently use gcc-3.2.  The 2.95 versions should also work well.
Versions of gcc between these two versions will quite likely generate
compilation errors (and make AMIDE unstable) if optimizations are used
when compiling.  The 2.96 versions of gcc (which are not official
releases!) are particularly notorious.



2) Gtk+/Gnome:

The current development series of AMIDE requires Gtk+-2 and GNOME-2.
I'm currently developing on a vanilla Redhat 8.0 system, although
other distributions of Linux with equivalent library support should
work also (i.e. Mandrake 9.0).  Any previous version of Redhat (and
many distributions) will require extensive modification to get the
current version of AMIDE to compile and run on it.  If you want to run
AMIDE on such a system, I'd suggest going with the AMIDE 0.6.* series,
which only needs Gtk+-1.2/Gnome-1.4.


Optional Packages
-----------------

1) (X)medcon/libmdc

(X)medcon includes a library (libmdc) which allows AMIDE to import the
following formats; Acr/Nema 2.0, Analyze (SPM), Concorde microPET,
DICOM 3.0, Ecat/Matrix 6.4, InterFile3.3 and Gif87a/89a.  Note that
CTI format is done by libecat if available (see below).

(X)medcon can be obtained from: 
	http://xmedcon.sourceforge.net


2) z_matrix_70/libecat

You will need this library if you want to import CTI 6.4 and 7.0 files
[(X)medcon only can handle CTI 6.4].  This library is released under a
non-free license (which is why it's not incuded with (X)MedCon).  It
can be found on the AMIDE sourceforge website, or at it's original
site:

	ftp://dormeur.topo.ucl.ac.be/pub/ecat/z_matrix_70/ecat.tar.gz

The source file off of amide.sourceforge.net is preferable, as it
includes a Makefile which will make a shared library, and a small
patch.  Since the license for libecat is non-GPL compatible, you
really should only link to it as a shared library.  A README file is
included with the tarball that explains how to configure/compile the
library.  RPM packages are also available off the AMIDE web site.



3) volpack/libvolpack

Volpack includes a library (libvolpack) which is used for the optional
volume rendering component of AMIDE.  

The original version can be found at:
	http://graphics.stanford.edu/software/volpack/

The version available on the AMIDE web site is preferable, as it's
been updated to compile cleanly under Linux.  RPM packages are also
available.

4) libfame

Another optional package, the fame library is used for generating
MPEG-1 movies from series of rendered images and for generating
fly-through movies.

Information, code, and binaries for libfame can be found at:
	http://fame.sourceforge.net



Building
--------

See the file INSTALL for info on compiling and installing.  If you
don't feel like reading that, try:

	./configure
	make 
	make install


If you're wondering about configuration options, a lot of information
can be obtained by running:

	./configure --help
