<para> 

  All imported files are converted into AMIDE's internal float
  representation, which is a compile time option that defaults to
  float (32 bit).  Importing is heavily dependent on Erik Nolf's
  medcon/libmdc medical imaging conversion library.

<sect2><title>ECAT Files</title>

  <para>
    
    Currently, static and dynamic ECAT 6.4 and 7.2 files are supported
    through medcon/libmdc.

  </para>

  <sect3><title>ECAT 6.4</title>
    <para>
      AMIDE will try to load any file ending in ".img" as a ECAT 6.4
      file.  This file format is used by both the microPET and some
      clinical scanners.
    </para>
  </sect3>

  <sect3><title>ECAT 7.0</title>
    <para>
      AMIDE will try to load any file ending in ".v" as a ECAT 7.2
      file.  This file format is used by newer clinical scanners.
    </para>
  </sect3>
      

</sect2>


<sect2><title>Raw Data Files</title>

  <para>
    AMIDE will attempt to load any file ending in ".dat" or ".raw"
    as a raw data file.  The user will be prompted for the
    dimensions of the study, the offset of the data in the file, and
    the data format of the data in the file.  Both big endian and
    little endian files can be loaded, with the following data
    formats supported: 8 bit integer, 16 bit signed or unsigned
    integer, 32 bit signed or unsigned integer, 32 bit IEEE floating
    point, and 64 bit IEEE floating point.
  </para>

<sect2><title>DICOM Files</title>
  
  <para>
    
    DICOM 3.0 is partially supported through medcon/libmdc, which
    actually uses a slightly modified version of Tony Voet's
    VT-DICOM library.  The level of support for DICOM 3.0 is
    entirely determined by medcon/libmdc/VT-DICOM.
    
    
  </para>
  
  
</sect2>


<sect2><title>Other Filetypes</title>

  <para>
    
    A variety of other file formats are supported through the use of
    medcon/libmdc, including: Acr/Nema 2.0, Analyze (SPM),
    InterFile3.3, and Gif87a/89a.  For more current information, check
    out the xmedcon/libmdc webpage at: http://xmedcon.sourceforge.net
