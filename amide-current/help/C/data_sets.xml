  After being loaded in, medical images can be manipulated in a
  variety of ways with AMIDE.  An important point to remember is that
  AMIDE deals with all medical images as 3 or 4 dimensional data sets.
  While 2D slices from the the data set are displayed on the computer
  screen, at no time does AMIDE handle images as anything less than 3
  dimensional data.

<sect1><title>Displaying a Data Set</title>

  <para>
    When initially loaded into the program, a data set is not
    displayed on the canvases.  Rather, the name of the data set is
    contained in the study list, and the user needs to select the
    data set in the study list so that it is displayed on the canvases.

  <sect2><title>Displaying Multiple Data Sets</title>
    <para>
      Displaying multiple data sets is as simple as importing more
      than one data set, and then selecting the data sets that you
      wish to view from the study list.

    <para>
      The time period over which the slices are drawn is determined by
      the time dialog, described in more detail by:
