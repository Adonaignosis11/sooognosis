   Instead of looking at three orthogonal slices through the data set,
   a series of slices (all of the same orientation) can also be
   examined.  Select: "View->Series->Space->[view]" from the menu to
   bring up the series of slices from a single frame.  Alternatively,
   select: "View->Series->Time->[view]" from the menu to bring up a
   series consisting of the same data slice over the time period of
   the study.  The thickness of the slices and which data sets are
   used are determined at the time the series window is brought up.  A
   slider appears on the top of the window which allows moving through
   the data set.  Note that since slices are cached in memory after
   being displayed, already displayed slices do not need to be
   regenerated from the data set and reviewing these slices is
   significantly faster.
