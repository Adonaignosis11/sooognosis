   Instead of looking at three orthogonal slices through the data set,
   a series of slices (all of the same orientation) can also be
   examined.  Select: "View->Series, and a dialog box will come up
   allowing you to pick which objects you'd like to display on the
   series viewer, along with if you'd like to display the slices over
   space, time, or gates.  The thickness of the slices are determined
   at the time the series window is brought up.  A slider appears on
   the top of the window which allows moving through the data set.
   Note that since slices are cached in memory after being displayed,
   already displayed slices do not need to be regenerated from the
   data set and reviewing these slices is significantly faster.
