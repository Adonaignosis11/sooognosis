  AMIDE currently supports two methods for aligning data sets to each
  other.  They are described below.

<sect1><title>Manual Alignment</title>
  
  <procedure>
    <title>Manual Alignment</title>
    <step>
      <para>
	First rotate each of the data sets so that they are level with
	respect to the transverse, coronal, and sagittal views.  This is
        easily done using the shift-2, and shift-3 mouse combinations, but 
        can also be done from the data set modification dialog.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
	Choose one of the data sets to be the active data set.  The other
        data set will be the "fixed" data set.  
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
	Shift the active data set so that the two data sets line up appropriately.
        This is easily done using the shift-1 mouse combination, but can also be
        done from the data set modification dialog.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        If fine tuning adjustments are needed, these are best done from the
        data set modification dialog.
      </para>
    </step>
  </procedure>          
  
</sect1>


<sect1><title>Semiautomated Alignment</title>
  
  <procedure>
    <title>Semiautomated Alignment</title>
    <step>
      <para>
       Specify at least four pairs of alignment points between the two
       data sets that you wish to align.  Drawing alignment points is
       described in <xref linkend="align-pt" />
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
       Run the alignment wizard (under tools->alignment wizard).  
      </para>
    </step>
  </procedure>          
  
</sect1>

<sect1 id="align-pt"><title>Drawing Alignment Points</title>
  <para>
   Alignment points can be added to any of the data sets in the study.
   To add an alignment point, hit the "Edit->Add alignment point" menu
   item, which will add an alignment point to the currently active
   data set.  Alternatively, hold down the shift button and press the
   right mouse button while hovering over a data set's name in the
   study list.  In either case, you will then be prompted for a name
   for the alignment point, and the point will then be placed at the
   currently viewed location.  The alignment point can be moved by
   clicking on the marker point shown in any of the views.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="align-pt-dialog-help"><title>Alignment Point Modification Dialog Box</title>
    <para>
      To modify parameters of an alignment point, first select and
      then right click the point in the study list.  The Alignment
      Point Modification Dialog Box will then appear.  Parameters that
      can be modified are listed below.
    </para>

    <sect3 id="align-pt-help-basic"><title>Basic Info</title>
      <para>
	The name, and location of the alignment point can be altered
	on this page.  Hitting the OK or Apply buttons will cause any
	changes made on this page to take effect.  Hitting Close will
	quit the dialog without making any changes.
      </para>
