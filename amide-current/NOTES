1) Slicing from all data sets at zoom=1.0, and then scaling using the
gdk_pixbuf_scale type functions doesn't work well, as the scale functions
don't do a great job of interpolation (circa gdk-pixbuf-0.18.0). 

2) Generating separate canvas object's for each data set slice doesn't
work for a couple reasons.  The first one is that if the background of the
canvas doesn't have an alpha, the background will be the widget color.  But
if the background does have an alpha, it will start to obscure low level pixels
in the data set.
