misc list of things todo:

big things:
* allow looking at only a subset of the data (i.e. cropping)
* magnifying glass
* gnuplot? interface for drawing graphs of ROI statistics

small things:
* make volume rendering less buggy.... 
* have a separate dialog for changing the view parameters
* figure out why gnome-help won't go to the right section
* have item tree indicate which object is currently focused, not just selected.
* have bottom scale indicate the width of data we're looking at...
	is this possible with GTK widgets?
* make caching of slices smarter.  We don't need to regenerate all slices
	when removing one slice from the list...
