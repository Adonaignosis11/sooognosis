misc list of things todo:


for next release?
-----------------
       
big things:
-----------
* aligning of data sets by specifying >= 3 points in each
* aligning of data using automated registration?
* guppi interface for drawing graphs of ROI statistics
* allow looking at only a subset of the data (i.e. cropping)
 
                       
small things:
-------------
* adding volume rendering of roi's should be relatively easy
* add thickness/line style for isocontours?
* figure out a better way of determining which slice we're drawning a 2D isocontour on
* gamma curve drawing still crashes program under MacX... don't use MacX for now
* change realpoint to 4D?
* figure out what to do with the extraneous study if you start
	amide, and then load in a file...
* add drag-n-drop capabilities between study windows
* put the canvases in a scrolled widget?
* make caching of slices smarter.  
	We don't need to regenerate all slices when removing one slice from the list
	slices shouldn't have to be the size of the largest dimensions
* fix zooming of roi's on the canvas
* should all voxel's that an roi edge passes through be displayed?
* when moving roi, should probably update roi dialog, same thing with volumes
* get libamide compiling correctly under OS X
* should add unique ID to each data set, This will allow cool things
	like having multiple volumes using and saving the same data set 
	(rather then having to copy the data).
* ISOCONTOUR_3D won't work quite right if the user is looking over multiple frames
	problem is in picking "frame" in ui_study_cb.c


probably before 1.0 things:
--------------
* if gtk_spin_button hasn't been fixed, fix it myself (check out gtkrange's DISCONTINUOUS mode)
* progress bars
* if we're not compiling in debug mode, have warning messages go to popup windows
* rewrite documentation
* add quad-linear interpolation for short time periods?
	would be especially useful for dynamic rendering movies
* all windows should have an exit menu item in addition to close

probably post 1.0 things:
----------------
* widgetization and changing of data types to glib style (i.e. amitk, and amilib)
* add corba/CIAS support
* add report generation.  This would add colormaps, location, thickness
	study name, volume name, scan date, etc. to the export function.
	Would handle multiple images.
* rendering alterations -> 
	3D red/green imaging
	allow rotation of light source and view in addition to object
	allow changing of material properties
* change mpeg_encode to a library? 
	would allow lose of "system" command, and proper progress reports, in ui_rendering_movie_dialog
* cardiac shaped ROI?


things dependent on other things: 
-------------- 
* figure out how to remove the last two uses of imlib (for exporting ppm files, and exporting
	files of any type).  gdk_pixbuf doesn't seem to have "write" capabilities
	- I believe this will be added in GTK 2.0
* gtk_spin_button -> multiple value_changed are emitted when the callback takes
	to long.  This is a gtk+ bug.
* when bug-buddy and the gnome-error-dialog support sourceforge bug reporting,
	delete the following line from amide.c so we can have bug reporting
	"signal(SIGSEGV, SIG_DFL);"
