misc list of things todo:


for next release?
-----------------
       
big things:
-----------
* multi-step undo/redo
* guppi interface for drawing graphs of ROI statistics
* allow looking at only a subset of the data (i.e. cropping)
* add drag-n-drop capabilities between study windows
* widgetize object modification dialogs
* add linked mode
                       
small things:
-------------
* widgetize the help_info 
* rewrite isocontour determining algorithm so it's not recursive,
* preset thresholds (bone window, fat window, etc.)
* add thickness/line style for isocontours?
* figure out a better way of determining which slice we're drawning a 2D isocontour on
* gamma curve drawing still crashes program under MacX... don't use MacX for now
* change realpoint to 4D?
* figure out what to do with the extraneous study if you start
	amide, and then load in a file...
* put the canvases in a scrolled widget?
* make caching of slices smarter.  
	We don't need to regenerate all slices when removing one slice from the list
	slices shouldn't have to be the size of the largest dimensions
* fix zooming of roi's on the canvas
* should all voxel's that an roi edge passes through be displayed?
* when moving roi, should probably update roi dialog, same thing with volumes
* get libamide compiling correctly under OS X
* should add unique ID to each data set, This will allow cool things
	like having multiple volumes using and saving the same data set 
	(rather then having to copy the data).
* ISOCONTOUR_3D won't work quite right if the user is looking over multiple frames
	problem is in picking "frame" in ui_study_cb.c
* isocontour erase function only updates at button release, not during mouse movement


probably before 1.0 things:
--------------
* if gtk_spin_button hasn't been fixed, fix it myself (check out gtkrange's DISCONTINUOUS mode)
* progress bars
* if we're not compiling in debug mode, have warning messages go to popup windows
* rewrite documentation
* add quad-linear interpolation for short time periods?
	would be especially useful for dynamic rendering movies

probably post 1.0 things:
----------------
* add corba/CIAS support
* add report generation.  This would add colormaps, location, thickness
	study name, volume name, scan date, etc. to the export function.
	Would handle multiple images.
* rendering alterations -> 
	3D red/green imaging
	allow rotation of light source and view in addition to object
	allow changing of material properties
	transformation to rendering structure is inefficient when doing multiple volumes,
		each volume should be transfered using it's minimal voxel size, not the
		group's maximum minimal voxel size.  the rendered images should then be scaled
		and overlapped.  
* change mpeg_encode to a library? 
	would allow lose of "system" command, and proper progress reports, in ui_rendering_movie_dialog
* cardiac shaped ROI?
* aligning of data using automated registration?


things dependent on other things: 
-------------- 
* GTK 2.0 Changes
	- when threshold or popup button hit, and dialog already up, bring to front
	- changing of data types so that they're g_objects
	- figure out how to remove the last two uses of imlib (for exporting ppm files, and exporting
		files of any type).  
* gtk_spin_button -> multiple value_changed are emitted when the callback takes
	to long.  This is a gtk+ bug.
* when bug-buddy and the gnome-error-dialog support sourceforge bug reporting,
	delete the following line from amide.c so we can have bug reporting
	"signal(SIGSEGV, SIG_DFL);"
* remove no-ops in raw_data.c when gcc > 3.0.3 comes out
