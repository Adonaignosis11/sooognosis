misc list of things todo:

big things:
* allow looking at only a subset of the data (i.e. cropping)
* magnifying glass
* gnuplot? interface for drawing graphs of ROI statistics
* dragging on the canvas changes the view thickness
* aligning of data sets by specifying three points in each


small things:
* figure out what's going wrong with my use of gtk_gamma_curve
	to set the density and gradient classification functions
* figure out why gnome-help won't go to the right section
* have item tree indicate which object is currently focused, not just selected.
* have bottom scale indicate the width of data we're looking at...
	is this possible with GTK widgets?
* make caching of slices smarter.  We don't need to regenerate all slices
	when removing one slice from the list...
* ui_main delete events should call ui_study_delete_event
* re-write realspace functions so that a pregenerated inverse matrix can be used
