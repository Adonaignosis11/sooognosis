misc list of things todo:

to be done for next release:
----------------------------


big things:
-----------
* aligning of data sets by specifying three points in each
* add the ability to generate rendered movies over multiple frames of data
* guppi? interface for drawing graphs of ROI statistics
	-plotutils instead?
* allow looking at only a subset of the data (i.e. cropping)
* progress bar
* rendering alterations -> 
	allow the user to grap the imag and spin it,
	replace x,y,z rotations with bottom and side of image rotations
	3D red/green imaging
	movie? are we rotating relative or absolute?
	allow rotation of light source and view in addition to object
* work around and remove the whole notion of "grains" for roi's

small things:
-------------
* change realpoint to 4D?
* add quad-linear interpolation for short time periods?
* figure out what to do with the extraneous study if you start
	amide, and then load in a file...
* put in markers on the series widget
* add drag-n-drop capabilities between study windows
* add axis indications somewhere, so user knows which way x,y,z is on each canvas 
	this should go on the volume dialog
* add to documentation 
	- how to align
	- rotating in volume dialog rotates around current view center
* core-dump when trying to create movie with a filename entered via a
	fileselection dialog.... it's a weird interaction with
	the fileselection dialog.... like the ui_rendering_movie
	structure is getting overwritten by the fileselection dialog
	box.... upgrade gtk?  currently all output is pegged to
	'out.mpeg'
* gamma_curves still aren't updating correctly
* put the canvases in a scrolled widget?
* cardiac shaped ROI?
* add ability to change material properties, lighting? for rendering
* make caching of slices smarter.  We don't need to regenerate all slices
	when removing one slice from the list...
* continue header file inclusion cleaning-up
* fix zooming of roi's on the canvas
* should all voxel's that an roi edge passes through be displayed?
* program preferences box?
	-width of roi lines
* add wait cursors to ui_rendering, probably want to make ui_study_place_cursor, etc.
	amide.c functions
* when moving roi, should probably update roi dialog, same thing with volumes
* get libamide compiling correctly under OS X

future things:
--------------
* figure out how to remove the last two uses of imlib (for exporting ppm files, and exporting
	files of any type).  gdk_pixbuf doesn't seem to have "write" capabilities
	- I believe this will be added in GTK 2.0

* gtk_spin_button -> multiple value_changed are emitted when the callback takes
	to long.  This is a gtk+ bug.

* when bug-buddy and the gnome-error-dialog support sourceforge bug reporting,
	delete the following line from amide.c so we can have bug reporting
	"signal(SIGSEGV, SIG_DFL);"


polish things:
--------------
* if we're not compiling in debug mode, have warning messages go to 
	popup windows
