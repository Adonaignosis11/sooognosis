misc list of things todo:

big things:
-----------
* aligning of data sets by specifying three points in each
* add the ability to generate rendered movies over multiple frames of data
* guppi? interface for drawing graphs of ROI statistics
	-plotutils instead?
* allow looking at only a subset of the data (i.e. cropping)
* change color compositing to an alpha based method, so that
	colormaps with white backgrounds can be composited together

small things:
-------------
* work around and remove the whole notion of "grains" for roi's
* add drag-n-drop capabilities between study windows
* add more interpolation methods when converting volumes for rendering.  currently only
	nearest neighbor, which doesn't work well when converting non-isometric voxels
	to the isometric voxels used by volpack
* add axis indications somewhere, so user knows which way x,y,z is on each canvas 
	ask Anna how this should be setup....
* add to documentation 
	- how to align
	- rotating in volume dialog rotates around current view center
* core-dump when trying to create movie with a filename entered via a
	fileselection dialog.... it's a weird interaction with
	the fileselection dialog.... like the ui_rendering_movie
	structure is getting overwritten by the fileselection dialog
	box.... upgrade gtk?  currently all output is pegged to
	'out.mpeg'
* gamma_curves still aren't updating correctly
* put the canvases in a scrolled widget?
* cardiac shaped ROI?
* add ability to change material properties, lighting? for rendering
* make caching of slices smarter.  We don't need to regenerate all slices
	when removing one slice from the list...
* re-write realspace functions so that a pregenerated inverse matrix can be used
	also change realspace_function to rs_function
* continue header file inclusion cleaning-up
* fix zooming of roi's on the canvas
* should all voxel's that an roi edge passes through be displayed?
* program preferences box?
	-width of roi lines


future things:
--------------
* figure out how to remove the last two uses of imlib (for exporting ppm files, and exporting
	files of any type).  gdk_pixbuf doesn't seem to have "write" capabilities....

* gtk_spin_button -> multiple value_changed are emitted when the callback takes
	to long.  This is a gtk+ bug.

* when bug-buddy and the gnome-error-dialog support sourceforge bug reporting,
	delete the following line from amide.c so we can have bug reporting
	"signal(SIGSEGV, SIG_DFL);"
