misc list of things todo:

note: list is small, as this branch is currently considered "stable", and no more development will be done on it.
                       
small things:
-------------
* ISOCONTOUR_2D drawing doesn't know the active slice... just using the 1st for now
* rewrite isocontour determining algorithm so it's not recursive
* fix zooming of roi's on the canvas
* should all voxel's that an roi edge passes through be displayed?


things dependent on other things: 
-------------- 
* when bug-buddy and the gnome-error-dialog support sourceforge bug reporting,
	delete the following line from amide.c so we can have bug reporting
	"signal(SIGSEGV, SIG_DFL);"
* remove no-ops in raw_data.c when gcc > 3.0.3 comes out
