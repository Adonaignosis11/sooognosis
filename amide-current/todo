misc list of things todo:

big things:
-----------

* gnuplot? interface for drawing graphs of ROI statistics
	-guppi might be want I want to use
* allow looking at only a subset of the data (i.e. cropping)
* magnifying glass
* dragging on the canvas changes the view thickness
	- leftclick & drag
* aligning of data sets by specifying three points in each
* rotating an image to level by specifying two dots on each view



small things:
-------------

* figure out how to get newlines in the .xml files so they're more legible
	when read as pure text
* figure out what's going wrong with my use of gtk_gamma_curve
	to set the density and gradient classification functions
* figure out why gnome-help won't go to the right section
* have item tree indicate which object is currently focused, not just selected.
* make caching of slices smarter.  We don't need to regenerate all slices
	when removing one slice from the list...
* ui_main delete events should call ui_study_delete_event
* re-write realspace functions so that a pregenerated inverse matrix can be used
	also change realspace_function to rs_function
* remove delete/edit/add object widgets on study window, instead:
	- have an edit menu with these functions
	- and also be able to add objects by right clicking on the non-used tree area
* continue header file inclusion cleaning-up
