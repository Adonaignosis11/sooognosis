misc list of things todo:

big things:
-----------

* gnuplot? interface for drawing graphs of ROI statistics
	-guppi might be want I want to use
	-plotutils?
* upgrade from gdk_imlib to gdk_pixbuf
* allow looking at only a subset of the data (i.e. cropping)
* magnifying glass
* aligning of data sets by specifying three points in each
* rotating an image to level by specifying two dots on each view
* allow scripting of rendering, allow for mpeg? output
* change color compositing to an alpha based method, so that
	colormaps with white backgrounds can be composited together

small things:
-------------

* when dragging an ROI, keep the center of the view the center of the ROI
* figure out why we lost the horizontal scrollbar on the tree widget
* put the canvases in a scrolled widget?
* figure out what's going wrong with my use of gtk_gamma_curve
	to set the density and gradient classification functions
* need to change the GtkCTree to GtkTree so we can get item specific help
* make caching of slices smarter.  We don't need to regenerate all slices
	when removing one slice from the list...
* ui_main delete events should call ui_study_delete_event
* re-write realspace functions so that a pregenerated inverse matrix can be used
	also change realspace_function to rs_function
* remove delete/edit/add object widgets on study window, instead:
	- have an edit menu with these functions
	- and also be able to add objects by right clicking on the non-used tree area
* continue header file inclusion cleaning-up
* fix zooming of roi's on the canvas
* should all voxel's that an roi edge passes through be displayed?
* program preferences box?
	-width of roi lines
