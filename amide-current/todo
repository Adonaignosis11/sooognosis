misc list of things todo:


for next release?
-----------------

big things:
-----------
* aligning of data sets by specifying three points in each
* guppi? interface for drawing graphs of ROI statistics
	-plotutils instead?
* allow looking at only a subset of the data (i.e. cropping)
* work around and remove the whole notion of "grains" for roi's
 
 
 
                       
small things:
-------------
* slices shouldn't have to be the size of the largest dimensions
* change realpoint to 4D?
* add quad-linear interpolation for short time periods?
	would be especially useful for dynamic rendering movies
* figure out what to do with the extraneous study if you start
	amide, and then load in a file...
* add drag-n-drop capabilities between study windows
* add axis indications somewhere, so user knows which way x,y,z is on each canvas 
	this should go on the volume dialog
* put the canvases in a scrolled widget?
* cardiac shaped ROI?
* make caching of slices smarter.  We don't need to regenerate all slices
	when removing one slice from the list...
* fix zooming of roi's on the canvas
* should all voxel's that an roi edge passes through be displayed?
* program preferences box?
	-width of roi lines
* when moving roi, should probably update roi dialog, same thing with volumes
* get libamide compiling correctly under OS X
* write a FileSelection widget that can handle directories

probably post 1.0 things:
----------------
* add corba/CIAS support
* add report generation.  This would add colormaps, location, thickness
	study name, volume name, scan date, etc. to the export function.
	Would handle multiple images.
* rendering alterations -> 
	3D red/green imaging
	allow rotation of light source and view in addition to object
	allow changing of material properties
* change mpeg_encode to a library? 
	would allow lose of "system" command, and proper progress reports, in ui_rendering_movie_dialog

things dependent on other things: 
-------------- 

* figure out how to remove the last two uses of imlib (for exporting ppm files, and exporting
	files of any type).  gdk_pixbuf doesn't seem to have "write" capabilities
	- I believe this will be added in GTK 2.0

* gtk_spin_button -> multiple value_changed are emitted when the callback takes
	to long.  This is a gtk+ bug.

* when bug-buddy and the gnome-error-dialog support sourceforge bug reporting,
	delete the following line from amide.c so we can have bug reporting
	"signal(SIGSEGV, SIG_DFL);"




polish things:
--------------
* progress bars
* if we're not compiling in debug mode, have warning messages go to 
	popup windows
* rewrite documentation
