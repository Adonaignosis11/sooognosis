misc list of things todo:

big things:
* allow looking at only a subset of the data (i.e. cropping)
* incorporate volume rendering, probably via adapting vol_render

small things:
* have item tree indicate which object is currently selected.
* finish off roi orientation
* add colormap/threshold/time frame support to the volume dialog box
* allow rotations to be entered
* make sure that unselecting frames is done intelligently
* have bottom scale indicate the width of data we're looking at...
	is this possible with GTK widgets?
* make caching of slices smarter.  We don't need to regenerate all slices
	when removing one slice from the list...


non-important/cleanup things:
* change roi_free(&roi) to roi=roi_free(roi);
* change volume_free(&vol) to vol=volume_free(vol);
