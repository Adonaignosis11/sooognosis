misc list of things todo:


for next release?
-----------------
* progress bars
* add .vol file support

comming soon
------------
* need to convert to glib/gtk 2.0 for g_object,
	also rename some objects
	volume -> data_set
	data_set -> raw_data
       
big things:
-----------
* guppi interface for drawing graphs of ROI statistics
* add drag-n-drop capabilities between study windows
                       
small things:
-------------
* ISOCONTOUR_2D drawing doesn't know the active slice... just using the 1st for now
* would changing the icons to .png files allow anti-aliasing?
* widgetize the help_info 
* rewrite isocontour determining algorithm so it's not recursive,
* add thickness/line style for isocontours?
* gamma curve drawing still crashes program under MacX... don't use MacX for now
* change realpoint to 4D?
* put the canvases in a scrolled widget?
* make caching of slices smarter.  
	We don't need to regenerate all slices when removing one slice from the list
	slices shouldn't have to be the size of the largest dimensions
* fix zooming of roi's on the canvas
* should all voxel's that an roi edge passes through be displayed?
* get libamide compiling correctly under OS X
* isocontour erase function only updates at button release, not during mouse movement


pre 1.0 things:
--------------
* rewrite documentation


probably post 1.0 things:
----------------
* add in a cropping wizard, to allow looking at only a subset of the data 
* multi-step undo/redo
* add report generation.  This would add colormaps, location, thickness
	study name, volume name, scan date, etc. to the export function.
	Would handle multiple images.
* rendering alterations -> 
	3D red/green imaging
	allow rotation of light source and view in addition to object
	allow changing of material properties
	transformation to rendering structure is inefficient when doing multiple volumes,
		each volume should be transfered using it's minimal voxel size, not the
		group's maximum minimal voxel size.  the rendered images should then be scaled
		and overlapped.  
* change mpeg_encode to a library? 
	would allow loss of "system" command, and proper 
	progress reports, in ui_rendering_movie_dialog
* aligning of data using automated registration?
* preset thresholds (bone window, fat window, etc.)


things dependent on other things: 
-------------- 
* GTK 2.0 Changes
	- when threshold or popup button hit, and dialog already up, bring to front
	- changing of data types so that they're g_objects
		all objects should be able to have each other as parents/children
	  then widgetize object modification dialogs
	- figure out how to remove the last two uses of imlib (for exporting ppm files, 
		and exporting files of any type).  
	- if gtk_spinbutton has a discontinous mode, remove work around (amitk_spin_button)
	- gtk_tree doesn't like to be removed and attached to containers, 
		starts displaying multiple trees
* changing to anti-aliased canvases, check with newer version of gnome canvas ( > 1.4.1.2.90)
	- all canvases are anti-aliased except for two:
	  1- amitk_canvas, libart coredumps and misdisplays some stuff
	  2- ui_preferences, line_style not followed by libart....
* when bug-buddy and the gnome-error-dialog support sourceforge bug reporting,
	delete the following line from amide.c so we can have bug reporting
	"signal(SIGSEGV, SIG_DFL);"
* remove no-ops in raw_data.c when gcc > 3.0.3 comes out
