several changes were made to get amide and supporting packages to
compile correctly under amide, here are the remaining outstanding
issues:

amide:
	1- may need to uncomment the gdk_imlib_destroy_image calls in 
		ui_threshold.c, these were changed from gnome_canvas_image_destroy
		calls that were definitely wrong, but this hasn't been tested
		yet (0.4.2)


xmedcon:
	1- needs an updated config.guess and config.sub (at least as of 0.6.1).
	2- symbol clashing between libmdc and libecat (not seen under linux).
		work around is to compile amide with either libecat or libmdc
		support, not both
