  <para> 

  As the use of AMIDE is bound to be completely intuitive only to the
    one who wrote the program (i.e. me), this chapter will provide a
    brief overview of the basic operating theory behind the program.

  </para>
  
  <sect1><title>Components of the Display</title>

    <sect2><title>Main Window</title>
      <para>
	When AMIDE starts up, a small window pops up sporting a cheesy
	AMIDE logo.  This small window is the launch point for
	creating new studies and loading in old ones.  Currently,
	nothing else is done from this window.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    

    <sect2><title>Study Window</title>
      <para>
	After starting a new study or opening an old one, the study
	window will be displayed.  A study is a collection of related
	objects (i.e. medical image data sets and regions of interest),
	and most of the user's actions will take place in this window.
	There are several elements to this window:
      </para>

      <sect3><title>Study List</title>
	<para>
	  On the left hand side of the study window is a list of all
	  the objects in the study arranged in a tree.  Objects in the
	  study list can be selected by left clicking on the object,
	  and can become the active focus of the study by either
	  double clicking on the object or clicking on the object with
	  the middle mouse button.  Note that making an ROI the active
	  object will center the canvases around that ROI. Object
	  modification dialog boxes can be brought up in one of two
	  ways; right clicking on the object, or hitting the "edit
	  item(s) button (which will bring up modification dialog
	  boxes for all selected items).  An "add roi" pull down menu
	  is available for adding different types of ROI's to the
	  study.  A "delete object(s)" button is also available which
	  will remove all objects that are currently selected from the
	  study.
	</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3><title>Study Canvases</title>
	<para>
	  In the middle of the study window are three canvases which
	  show three orthogonal 3-dimensional slices taken from the
	  data sets.  The thickness of the slices is determined by the
	  "thickness" widget on the right side of the study window.
	  The three canvases should be showing you transverse,
	  coronal, and sagittal sections through the medical image
	  data sets being analyzed.  Which data sets and regions of
	  interest that are displayed on the canvases are determined
	  by which of these objects are selected in the study list on
	  the left side of the screen.  Below the canvases are dials
	  for selecting where in the data set the displayed slices
	  should be taken from.  Slice location can also be changed by
	  directly clicking on the canvases.  The thickness of the
	  slices can also be changed by clicking the middle mouse
	  button (which will minimize the thickness) or by
	  click-n-dragging with the right mouse button (which allows
	  interactive specification of the thickness).

      </para
    </sect3>


      <sect3><title>Misc. Widgets</title>
	<para>
	  On the right side of the study window are several widgets
	  used for adjusting the most commonly changed display
	  parameters.  Scaling, interpolation, zoom, and thickness are
	  global options and will affect all displayed data sets.
	  Color table and threshold only apply to the data set that
	  currently has the active focus.
	</para>

	<sect4><title>Scaling</title>
	  <para>
	    The user has the option of specifying whether each slice
	    should be scaled individually by the maximum and minimum
	    values in that slice, or if the slices should be scaled to
	    the maximum and minium values in their respective data sets.
	  </para>
	</sect4>
	
	<sect4><title>Color Table</title>
	  <para>
	    The color table widget allows the user to change the
	    color table/map of the currently focused object.
	  </para>
	  </sect4>

	<sect4><title>Interpolation</title>
	  <para>
	    The user can specify what type of interpolation to use for
	    generating the slices displayed on the canvas.  Nearest
	    neighbhor is by far the quickest.  2x2x1 does a square
	    smoothing filter on the data and is 4x slower than nearest
	    neighbor.  2x2x2 does a box smoothing filter on the data
	    and is 8x slower than nearest neighbor.  Bi-linear and
	    Tri-linear interpolations produce the best looking images but
	    are very slow.
	  </para>
	</sect4>

	<sect4><title>Threshold</title>
	  <para>
	    This button will pop-up a threshold widget which can be
	    used for scaling the currently focused data set.  Other
	    data sets can be thresholded by either placing them as the
	    focus or by using the data set modification dialog.  The
	    threshold dialog is described below.
	  </para>
	</sect4>

	<sect4><title>Zoom</title>
	  <para>
	    This specificies how much to enlarge the canvas for
	    viewing.  AMIDE tries to make an educated guess about how
	    large the display of the data set should be.  Zoom can be
	    used in addition to that guesswork.
	  </para>
	</sect4>

	<sect4><title>Time Pop-up</title>
	  <para>
	    This is another button to pop-up a dialog box.  The time
	    dialog box allows the user to specify the time interval
	    over which data should be displayed.
	  </para>
	</sect4>

	<sect4><title>Thickness</title>
	  <para>
	    Thickness specifies how deep the slices displayed on the
	    study canvas are.
	  </para>
	</sect4>



      </sect3>


    </sect2>

    <sect2><title>Threshold Dialog</title>
      <para>
	The threshold dialog allows the threshold and colormap of the
	currently focused data set to be altered.  On the left are
	entry boxes where the maximum and minimum thresholds can be
	entered, either in percent of the data set's maximum and
	minimum levels or as absolute values.  On the right is a bar
	graph showing the distribution of the data set's values.  On
	the far right is a color scale from which the thresholds can
	also be altered.  The color table of the data set can also be
	altered from this dialog.

      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2><title>Series View Window</title>
      <para>
	Instead of looking at three orthogonal slices through the data
	set, a series of slices (all of the same orientation) can also
	be examined.  Select:
	"View->Series->Transverse/Coronal/Sagittal" from the menu
	to bring up the series of slices.  The thickness,
	interpolation, time frame, and orientation of the slices are
	all determined at the time this window is brought up, although
	the threshold and color table can still be altered.  A dial
	appears on the top of the window which allows moving through
	the data set.  Note that since slices are cached in memory
	after being displayed, already displayed slices do not need to
	be regenerated from the data set and reviewing these slices is
	significantly faster.
      </para>
    </sect2>


    <sect2 id="time-dialog-help"><title>Time Dialog</title>
      <para>
	The time dialog lets the user pick over which time period data
	should be displayed.  Since data sets are often composed of
	non-regular duration frames, the abstraction between the user
	interface and the underlying format of the data set has been
	dropped in this case and the user is presented with a list of
	the frames of data arranged in chronological order.  A time
	period (i.e. frame) can be selected by clicking on a list
	element.  Multiple frames can be selected by holding down the
	shift key and selecting on additional frames.  Non-contigous
	selections are not allowed.  Note that for each selected data
	set, at least one frame will be highlighted.  If the choosen
	time period does not encompose a frame for a given data set,
	the closest frame will be choosen.  Hitting the OK or Apply
	buttons will cause any changes made on this page to take
	effect.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="volume-dialog-help"><title>Data Set Modification Dialog Box</title>
      <para>
	To modify parameters of a data set, first select the data set
	in the study list and then right click on the data set.  The
	Data Set Modification Dialog Box will then appear.  Parameters
	that can be modified are divided into the following pages.
      </para>

      <sect3 id="volume-dialog-help-basic"><title>Basic Info</title>
	<para>
	  The name, type of modality, and conversion factor can be
	  altered on this page.  The conversion factor is a parameter
	  that is multiplied to the data set before it is used for
	  viewing or quantitation.  Since the data set is in
	  ECAT/MAP/abitrary scale units, the conversion factor can be
	  used in order to analyze the data set in another type of
	  reference unit (i.e. Percent Injected Dose [%ID]).  Hitting
	  the OK or Apply buttons will cause any changes made on this
	  page to take effect.
	</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="volume-dialog-help-center-dimensions"><title>Center/Dimensions</title>
	<para>
	  The data set can be shifted by respecifing the center of the
	  data set with respect to the origin.  The x, y, and z
	  dimensions are in millimeters.  Being able to change the
	  center of the data set is useful for manually aligning multiple
	  data sets.  The size of the data set's voxels (again, in
	  millimeters) can also be altered on this page.  The "keep
	  aspect ratio" button specifies that when altering the size
	  of any voxel component (x, y, or z), the relative sizes
	  between the components should be kept the same.  Hitting the
	  OK or Apply buttons will cause any changes made on this page
	  to take effect. </para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="volume-dialog-help-rotate"><title>Rotate</title>
	<para>
	  The data set can be rotated around its center in this page.
	  This comes in useful when the data set doesn't quite line-up
	  with the transverse/coronal/sagittal planes.  There is one
	  dial for each of the three slice planes.  The transverse
	  dial will spin the data set in the transverse plane
	  (i.e. rotate on the z-axis).  The coronal dial will spin the
	  data set in the coronal plane (i.e. rotate on the y-axis).
	  And the sagittal dial will spin the data set in the sagittal
	  plane (i.e. rotate on the x-axis).  The "reset to default"
	  button allows the data set to be rotated back to it's
	  initial orientation.  On the bottom of this page is a matrix
	  showing the coordinate frame of the data set with respect to
	  the base coordinate frame.  Hitting the OK or Apply buttons
	  will cause any changes made on this page to take
	  effect. </para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="volume-dialog-help-colormap-threshold"><title>Colormap/Threshold</title>
	<para>
	  This page is analogous to the threshold dialog (described
	  above).  Any changes made on this page are immediately
	  carried out.
	</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="volume-dialog-help-time"><title>Time</title>
	<para>
	  From this page, the timing information of the data set can
	  be altered.  Scan start time can be used for altering the
	  start time of the scan with respect to other data sets.
	  Corrections in the duration of each data frame can also be
	  made on this page.  Hitting the OK or Apply buttons will
	  cause any changes made on this page to take effect. </para>
      </sect3>

    </sect2>


    <sect2 id="roi-dialog-help"><title>Region of Interest Modification Dialog Box</title>
      <para>
	To modify parameters of an ROI, first select the ROI in the
	study list and then right click on the data set.  The ROI
	Modification Dialog Box will then appear.  Parameters that can
	be modified are divided into the following pages.
      </para>

      <sect3 id="roi-dialog-help-basic"><title>Basic Info</title>
	<para>
	  The name, type of ROI, and grain level of can be altered on
	  this page.  The grain level determines how finely to
	  sub-divide voxels when calculating statistics for an ROI.
	  Hitting the OK or Apply buttons will cause any changes made
	  on this page to take effect.
	</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3  id="roi-dialog-helpcenter"><title>Center</title>
	<para>
	  The center of the ROI can be shifted with respect to the
	  origin on this page.  The x, y, and z parameters are in
	  millimeters Hitting the OK or Apply buttons will cause any
	  changes made on this page to take effect. </para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3  id="roi-dialog-help-dimensions"><title>Dimensions</title>
	<para>
	  The size of the ROI can be altered from this page.  The x',
	  y', and z' dimensions are in millimeters and are orientated
	  with respect to the ROI.  Hitting the OK or Apply buttons
	  will cause any changes made on this page to take
	  effect. </para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="roi-dialog-help-rotate"><title>Rotate</title>
	<para>
	  The ROI can be rotated around its center in this page.
	  There is one dial for each of the three slice planes.  The
	  transverse dial will spin the ROI in the transverse plane
	  (i.e. rotate on the z-axis).  The coronal dial will spin the
	  ROI in the coronal plane (i.e. rotate on the y-axis).  And
	  the sagittal dial will spin the ROI in the sagittal plane
	  (i.e. rotate on the x-axis).  The "reset to default" button
	  allows the ROI to be rotated back to it's initial
	  orientation.  On the bottom of this page is a matrix showing
	  the coordinate frame of the ROI with respect to the base
	  coordinate frame.  Hitting the OK or Apply buttons will
	  cause any changes made on this page to take effect. </para>
