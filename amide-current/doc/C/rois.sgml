  <title>Using ROI's</title>
  
  <para> 

    ROI stands for Region of Interest.  ROI's designate a volume on
    the object over which statistics should be calculated.

  <sect2><title>ROI Types</title>

    <para>
      The following ROI types are currently supported.
    </para>

    <sect3><title>Ellipsoid</title>
      <para>
	An ellipsoid is similar to a sphere, but with a radius
	specified for each direction [x,y,z].  In the case of x=y=z,
	the ellipsoid is a sphere.
      </para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3><title>Elliptic Cylinder</title>
      <para>
	An elliptic cylinder is similar to a regular cylinder, except
	it has an ellipse as it's base instead of a circle.
      </para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3><title>Box</title>
      <para>
	Exactly what it says, a 3D box.
      </para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3><title>Group</title>
      <para>
	Not currently implemented.  This will someday allow ROI's to
	be defined in groups, so that ROI's can be manipulated both in
	groups and individually.
      </para>

  <sect2><title>Drawing ROI's</title>

    <para>
      To draw an ROI, first select the ROI desired under the "add
      ROI:" pull down menu.  Amide will request a name for this ROI
      and add it to the study item list, but no ROI will be drawn.  To
      draw this new ROI, you need to first select the ROI by either
      double clicking with the left button or clicking with the middle
      button the ROI in the study item list.  After selecting the ROI,
      it can be drawn on any of the displayed views of the current
      volumes.  The x and y dimensions of the ROI are controlled by
      the size of the drawing.  The z dimension ("depth") of the newly
      drawn ROI is determined by the current image thickness.
    </para>
    
  </sect2>

  <sect2><title>Manipulating ROI's</title>

    <para>
      After an ROI is drawn, it can be further manipulated to adjust
      it's size, placement, and orientation.  First double click with
      the left button or select with the middle button the ROI in the
      study item list to ensure that this ROI is the currently
      selected item.  You can then directly manipulate the ROI by
      clicking on it in any of the volume view windows.  Mouse button
      1 is used for zooming the ROI.  Mouse button 2 is used to rotate
      the ROI.  And Mouse button 3 is used to shift the ROI.

      You can also edit the ROI size/placement/orientation/name
      etc. by clicking on mouse button 3 while over the ROI's name in
      the study item list.  This brings up the edit ROI dialog, which
      allows keyboard entry of the ROI's parameters.
