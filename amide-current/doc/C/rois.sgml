  <para> 

    ROI stands for Region of Interest.  ROI's designate a volume on
    the object over which statistics should be calculated.

  <sect1><title>ROI Types</title>

    <para>
      The following ROI types are currently supported.
    </para>

    <sect2><title>Ellipsoid</title>
      <para>
	An ellipsoid is similar to a sphere, but with a radius
	specified for each direction [x,y,z].  In the case of x=y=z,
	the ellipsoid is a sphere.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2><title>Elliptic Cylinder</title>
      <para>
	An elliptic cylinder is similar to a regular cylinder, except
	it has an ellipse as it's base instead of a circle.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2><title>Box</title>
      <para>
	Exactly what it says, a 3D box.
      </para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2><title>Group</title>
      <para>
	Not currently implemented.  This will someday allow ROI's to
	be defined in groups, so that ROI's can be manipulated both in
	groups and individually.
      </para>
    </sect2>

  <sect1><title>Drawing ROI's</title>

    <para>
      To draw an ROI, first select the ROI desired under the "add
      ROI:" pull down menu.  Amide will request a name for this ROI
      and add it to the study item list, but no ROI will be drawn.  To
      draw this new ROI, you need to first make the new ROI the active
      object by either double clicking with the left button or
      clicking with the middle button the ROI in the study item list.
      After selecting the ROI, it can be drawn on any of the displayed
      views of the current volumes.  The x and y dimensions of the ROI
      are controlled by the size of the drawing.  The z dimension
      ("depth") of the newly drawn ROI is determined by the current
      image thickness.
    </para>
    
  </sect1>

  <sect1><title>Manipulating ROI's</title>

    <para>
      After an ROI is drawn, it can be further manipulated to adjust
      it's size, placement, and orientation.  First double click with
      the left button or select with the middle button the ROI in the
      study item list to ensure that this ROI is the currently
      activated object.  You can then directly manipulate the ROI by
      clicking on it in any of the volume view windows.  Mouse button
      1 is used to shift the ROI.  Mouse button 2 is used to rotate
      the ROI.  And Mouse button 3 is used for zooming the ROI.

      You can also edit the ROI size/placement/orientation/name
      etc. by clicking on mouse button 3 while over the ROI's name in
      the study item list.  This brings up the edit ROI dialog, which
      allows keyboard entry of the ROI's parameters.

    </para>
    
  </sect1>

  <sect1><title>Calculating Statistics over ROI's</title>

    <para>
      Statistics on an ROI can be calculated via the analysis menu.
      Choosing "All" will calculate all the ROI's on the currently
      selected images.  Choosing "Selected" will calculate the
      selected ROI's on the currently selected images.
    </para>
    
  </sect1>

<sect1><title>Grain size</title> 
  <para>
    The grain size determines how many sub-voxels each voxel will be
    divided into when calculating an ROI's statistics.  A higher
    grain (meaning more sub-voxels) will calculate more accurate
    statistics at the expensive of increased calculation times.
  </para>
  
</sect1>

<sect1><title>Gotcha's to ROI calculations </title>

  <sect2><title>My ROI statistics are zero</title>

    <para>
      This probably means your ROI is very thin in one of its
      dimensions.  Try either increasing the size of the ROI, or
      increasing the grain size used when calculation the statistics.
    </para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2><title>Variance/Std. Dev./Std. Err. Fallacies</title>

    <para>
      A common fallacy is to use the calculated variance (or standard
      deviation, or standard error) of an ROI as an experiment's variance.
      The variance of an experiment can only truly be measured by
      taking multiple samples (i.e. performing multiple scans) and
      calculating the variance between these different samples.
      The variance that AMIDE calculates is only a measure of the
      noise within an ROI in the given data set.
