  <title>Importing Files</title>
  
  <para> 

    All imported files are converted into AMIDE's internal float
    representation, which is double (64 bit) by default.

  <sect2><title>CTI Files</title>

    <para>
      Currently, static and dynamic CTI 6.4 and 7.0 files are
      supported.  AMIDE support for the CTI file format is
      accomplished through the libecat C library.
    </para>

    <sect3><title>CTI 6.4</title>
      <para>
	AMIDE will try to load any file ending in ".img" as a CTI 6.4
	file.  This file format is used by both the microPET and some
	clinical scanners.  
      </para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3><title>CTI 7.0</title>
      <para>
	AMIDE will try to load any file ending in ".v" as a CTI 7.0
	file.  This file format is used by newer clinical scanners.
      </para>

  <sect2><title>Raw Data Files</title>

    <para>
      AMIDE will attempt to load any file ending in ".dat" or ".raw"
      as a raw data file.  The user will be prompted for the
      dimensions of the study, the offset of the data in the file, and
      the data format of the data in the file.  Both big endian and
      little endian files can be loaded, with the following data
      formats supported: 8 bit integer, 16 bit signed or unsigned
      integer, 32 bit signed or unsigned integer, 32 bit IEEE floating
      point, and 64 bit IEEE floating point.
