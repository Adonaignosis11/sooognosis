  After being loaded in, medical images can be manipulated in a
  variety of ways with AMIDE.  An important point to remember is that
  AMIDE deals with all medical images as 3 or 4 dimensional data sets.
  While 2D slices from the the data set are displayed on the computer
  screen, at no time does AMIDE handle images as anything less than 3
  dimensional data.

<sect1><title>Displaying a Data Set</title>

  <para>
    When initially loaded into the program, a data set is not
    displayed on the canvases.  Rather, the name of the data set is
    contained in the study list, and the user needs to select the
    data set in the study list so that it is displayed on the canvases.
  </para>
  
  <sect2><title>Displaying Multiple Data Sets</title>
    <para>
      Displaying multiple data sets is as simple as importing more
      than one data set, and then selecting the data sets that you
      wish to view from the study list.
    </para>

  <sect2><title>Handling Dynamic Data Sets</title>
    <para>
      The time period over which the slices are drawn is determined by
      the time dialog, described in more detail by:

<sect1><title>Aligning Data Sets</title>
  
  <para>
    Aligning of data sets in amide is currently done manually.  The
    easiest way to align data sets manually is as follows:
  </para>
  
  <procedure>
    <title>Manual Alignment</title>
    <step>
      <para>
	First rotate the data sets so that they are level with
	respect to the transverse, coronal, and sagittal views.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
	Set the center of each of the data sets to the origin
	(0,0,0).
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
	Choose one of the data sets to be the "fixed" data set.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
	Then slowly alter the center of the data sets relative to
	the "fixed" data set until the data sets overly each other
	as desired.
      </para>
    </step>
  </procedure>          
  
  <para>
    In the future for amide... semi-automated and automated (mutual
    information?) based registration methods
