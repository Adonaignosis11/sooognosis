    After being loaded in, medical images can be manipulated in a
    variety of ways with AMIDE.  An important point to remember is
    that AMIDE deals with all medical images as 3 or 4 dimensional
    data sets.  While the data is displayed as 2D images on the
    computer screen, at no time does AMIDE handle images as anything
    less than 3 dimensional data.

      When initially loaded into the program, a data set is not
      displayed on the canvases.  Rather, the name of the data set is
      contained in the study list, and the user needs to select the
      data set in the study list so that it is displayed on the canvases.
