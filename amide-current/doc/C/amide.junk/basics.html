  As the use of AMIDE is bound to be completely intuitive only to the
    one who wrote the program (i.e. me), this chapter will provide a
    brief overview of the basic operating theory behind the program.

	A study is a collection of related objects (i.e. medical image
	data sets and regions of interest), and most of the user's
	actions will take place in this window.  There are several
	elements to this window:

>	  On the left hand side of the study window is a list of all
	  the objects in the study arranged in a tree.  Objects in the
	  study list can be selected by left clicking on the object,
	  and can become the active focus of the study by either
	  double clicking on the object or clicking on the object with
	  the middle mouse button.  Note that making an ROI the active
	  object will center the canvases around that ROI. Object
	  modification dialog boxes can be brought up in one of two
	  ways; right clicking on the object, or hitting the
	  "edit-&#62;edit" menu item (which will bring up modification
	  dialog boxes for all selected items).  ROI's can be added by
	  either right clicking on an empty area of the study tree, or
	  hitting the "edit-&#62;add ROI" menu item.  To delete objects,
	  hit the "edit-&#62;delete" menu item, which will delete the
	  currently selected objects.

>	  In the middle of the study window are three canvases which
	  show three orthogonal 3-dimensional slices taken from the
	  data sets.  The thickness of the slices is determined by the
	  "thickness" widget on the right side of the study window.
	  The three canvases should be showing you transverse,
	  coronal, and sagittal sections through the medical image
	  data sets being analyzed.  Which data sets and regions of
	  interest that are displayed on the canvases are determined
	  by which of these objects are selected in the study list on
	  the left side of the screen.  Below the canvases are dials
	  for selecting where in the data set the displayed slices
	  should be taken from.  Slice location can also be changed by
	  directly clicking on the canvases.  The various mouse clicks
	  available are as followings:

	    neighbhor is by far the quickest.  2x2x1 does a square
	    smoothing filter on the data and is 4x slower than nearest
	    neighbor.  2x2x2 does a box smoothing filter on the data
	    and is 8x slower than nearest neighbor.  Bi-linear and
	    Tri-linear interpolations produce the best looking images but
	    are very slow.

	to bring up the series of slices.  The thickness,

	all determined at the time this window is brought up, although
	the threshold and color table can still be altered.  A dial
	appears on the top of the window which allows moving through
	the data set.  Note that since slices are cached in memory
	after being displayed, already displayed slices do not need to

	interface and the underlying format of the data set has been
	dropped in this case and the user is presented with a list of
	the frames of data arranged in chronological order.  A time
	period (i.e. frame) can be selected by clicking on a list
	element.  Multiple frames can be selected by holding down the
	shift key and selecting on additional frames.  Non-contigous
	selections are not allowed.  Note that for each selected data
	set, at least one frame will be highlighted.  If the choosen
	time period does not encompose a frame for a given data set,
	the closest frame will be choosen.  Hitting the OK or Apply
